# Tech-Degree-Project-1
This repository contains the first project on the Python tech-degree program. 
Within this repository is the number guessing game which is designed to give the player the option to play a game in which they have to pick the correct number from a randomly generated number. 
The game is designed to store a highscore, allow multiple attempts, give user feedback, and give various messages throughout that tell where the user is in regards to ending the game, playing again, or saying good bye.
I have written all of this code myself, and I am trying for the exceptional grade. 
I have tried writing the game in different ways, but this seems to work the best. At least so far. 
I thank all those that are grading this for your time and effort and look forward to learning more from everyone at Treehouse. 
Thank you for stopping by!


To be clear I am trying for the exceeds expectations grade, and would love any type of feedback so that I can better my Python knowledge.
Thank you!
